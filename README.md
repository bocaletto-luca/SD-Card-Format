## Key Features

- **Removable Drive Selection:** SD-Card Format Free allows users to select the desired removable drive from a convenient dropdown list. This is especially useful when multiple SD memory cards are connected to the computer.

- **Refresh Removable Drive List:** The application includes an "Update" button that enables users to automatically detect currently connected removable drives. This ensures that the list is always up-to-date, making it easy for users to select the drive they wish to format.

- **Easy Formatting:** Once the desired drive is selected, users can initiate the formatting process with a simple click of the "Format" button. The software will then execute the formatting command with the FAT32 file system on the selected drive.

- **Status Notifications:** SD-Card Format Free provides informative notifications to the user. A message window displays a confirmation message when formatting is successfully completed. In case of an error during the process, an error message is displayed to inform the user of the encountered issue.
